*Current State:*  
YardConnect is fully functional with authentication, profile management, search, reviews, and Stripe-powered subscription payments.  
The platform is ready for production hardening and launch, with webhooks and advanced features as the next steps.

## üöÄ Next Steps for Production

1. **Buy a custom domain and configure DNS**
   - Purchase a domain (e.g., from Namecheap, GoDaddy, Google Domains)
   - Set up DNS for both web hosting and email authentication
   - This is required for domain authentication and professional email sending
2. **Set up domain authentication (SPF/DKIM) in SendGrid** *(Pending domain purchase)*
   - Improves deliverability and reduces chance of emails going to spam
   - Requires access to your domain's DNS settings
   - Recommended for all production email sending
3. **Migrate file uploads from local storage to cloud storage (e.g., AWS S3, Cloudinary)**
   - Ensures scalability and reliability for user-uploaded images
4. **Set up Stripe webhooks for robust subscription/payment management**
   - Enables real-time updates for payment events and subscription status
5. **Enable HTTPS and security hardening**
   - Use SSL certificates, set secure cookies, and review CORS settings
6. **Monitor logs and error reporting**
   - Set up logging and error monitoring (e.g., Sentry, LogRocket)
7. **Test all flows end-to-end**
   - Review, payment, profile, and search flows on both desktop and mobile
