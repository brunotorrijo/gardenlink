# YardConnect – Connect Homeowners with Local Lawn Care Workers

A *lead generation platform* that connects homeowners with local lawn care workers for yard maintenance and landscaping services. Yard workers pay a monthly subscription to appear on the platform, and clients can contact them directly—no client login required.

## 🏢 *Business Model*
